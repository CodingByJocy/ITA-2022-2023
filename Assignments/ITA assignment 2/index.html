            <strong>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 - 12 March 1935)</strong>, also known as <em>Michael I.</em> <br> Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. 
            <br>
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as <em>"pupinization"</em>). 
            <br>
            Pupin was a founding member of <strong>National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)</strong> on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.
